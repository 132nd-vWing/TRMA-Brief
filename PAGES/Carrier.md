# Instructions for Using the CASE 3 Marshall Stack System

Welcome to the CASE 3 Marshall Stack System! This tool is designed to help players manage landing sequences in a realistic carrier recovery operation. Here’s a simple guide on how to use it.

---

## Overview

This system allows players to:
- **Join** the Marshall Stack (CASE III) when they're ready to recover.
- **Leave** the stack if they no longer want to land.
- **View** the current stack positions to see their landing order.
- **Automatically update** positions when players join, leave, or disconnect.
- **Receive notifications** relevant to players in the Marshall Stack.

---

## How to Use the System

### 1. Enter the Marshall Zone

- When you fly within **50 nautical miles** of the carrier, you will automatically be detected and enter the **Marshall Zone**.
- Once you're in this zone, a menu option will appear for you to **add yourself to the Marshall Stack (CASE III only)**.

### 2. Add Yourself to the Marshall Stack

- To add yourself to the Marshall Stack, open the menu labeled **"Case 3 Operations"** in your comms or command menu.
- Select **[Your Name] - Add Yourself to the Marshall Stack (CASE III only)** from the options.
- Once you join the stack:
  - You’ll be assigned a position in the **Push-Sequence**.
  - The system will dynamically create an option for you to **Leave the Stack** if needed.

### 3. Leave the Marshall Stack

- If you decide not to land or no longer need to be in the stack, you can choose the **Leave Stack** option in the **Case 3 Operations** menu.
- This will remove you from the Marshall Stack and update the positions of other players.

### 4. View the Current Marshall Stack

- To see the current Marshall Stack order, select **"Display the Marshall Stack"** from the **Case 3 Operations** menu.
- This will show you the list of all players in the stack, including:
  - Their assigned positions.
  - The distance from the carrier (Marshall Mother).
  - Altitude (stack height).
  - The **push time** (when each player should start their approach).

### 5. Automatic Updates

- If a player disconnects or leaves the Marshall Zone, they are automatically removed from the stack, and the positions are updated for everyone else.
- The system ensures that all changes in the stack are reflected in real-time.

### 6. Notifications

- You will receive notifications when:
  - You join or leave the stack.
  - Someone else leaves or is removed from the stack.
  - Your position in the stack changes.
  - The current Marshall Stack (push sequence) is displayed.

---

## Summary of Commands

- **Add Yourself to the Marshall Stack (CASE III only)**: Adds you to the Marshall Stack and assigns a position in the push-sequence.
- **Leave the Marshall Stack**: Removes you from the stack and adjusts the positions of other players.
- **Display the Marshall Stack**: Shows the current list of players in the Marshall Stack and their positions.

---

## Important Notes

- You will only receive notifications and updates if you are within the **Marshall Zone** (50 nautical miles from the carrier).
- Positions are based on when you add yourself to the stack. The first person to join will have the earliest push time, and subsequent players will follow based on their join order.
- If you disconnect, the system will automatically remove you from the stack to ensure a smooth operation for other players.
