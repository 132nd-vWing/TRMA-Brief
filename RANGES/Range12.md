# Range 12

## Defensive CAS scenario
Enemy territory is to the SOUTH and EAST, friendly territory to the NORTH and WEST.

Friendly forces are on the defensive and have started a withdrawal of own forces due to enemy breakthrough. 
A friendly Mechanized Infantry Battalion is in defensive positions protecting a key bridge, preventing enemy forces to cross the bridge to 
continue their pursuit NORTHWEST toward MELFJORDBOTN. At MELFJORDBOTN a friendly brigadeheadquarter are in the process of packing down and 
withdraw further NORTH. 
A friendly observation post is located 3NM SOUTH, SOUTH-EAST of JTAC location (see NO-FIRE ZONE in CombatFlite). In addition, it is LIKELY
that a friendly recon force also have a observation post in the area.

Enemy forces are a Company Task Group (CTG) consisting of two mechanized infantry platoons and one platoon of MBT, supported by artillery and air defence. 

Ground Force Commanders (GFC) intention for CAS:
Support Mechanized Infantry Battalion and prevent enemy forces from crossing bridge and continue pursuit toward MELFJORDBOTN

GFC priorities:
- Priority 1: 100% of Main Battle Tanks
- Priority 2: 50% of IFV
- Priority 3: Artillery

GFC have approved Type 1, Type 2 and Type 2 Airborne observer. Type 3. not approved due to friendly observation posts.
Dange Close: GFC initials: H.M. For danger close attacks only Type 1 is approved. For Type one, only forward firing munitions approved (guns+rockets)

Western military equipment is friendlies
Eastern military equipment is enemy forces


What you can see is what the scenario is. You will have friendly units on F10 map as you are able to communicate with friendly forces
and know where they are. Enemy units are hidden from the F10 map and you need to scan the target area to locate enemy forces.
