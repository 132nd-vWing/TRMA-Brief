# Range 15

## Basic Close Air Support Scenario
Enemy territory is to the EAST. Friendly territory to the WEST
In the target area friendly forces have been cut-off from other friendlies and are beeing pushed NORTH. A friendly motorized infantry platoon have 
encountered a stronger enemy force supported by artillery and air defence. Friendly forces currently pinned down NORTHWEST of a village. North of the motorized
infantry platoon there is friendly mortar in support. JTAC is on a hill overlookin the area and supporting friendly forces.
Intelligence indicate that  enemy in the area is a motorized infantry company, supported by  mortar, artillery and a platoon of MBTs.
We have reportings of an enemy SA-13 3nm NORTH-EAST of friendly location..

Ground Force Commanders (GFC) intention for CAS: Support the friendly forces and provide CAS to neutralize high value targets

GFC priorities:
- Priority 1: Artillery
- Priority 2: Main Battle Tanks
- Priority 3: Infantry fighting vehicles

GFC have approved Type 1, Type 2 and Type 2 Airborne observer. Type 3. Is approved outside 1km of friendly forces.
Dange Close: GFC initials: H.M. For danger close attacks only Type 1 is approved. For Type one, only forward firing munitions approved (guns+rockets)


Western military equipment is friendlies
Eastern military equipment is enemy forces

What you can see is what the scenario is. You will have friendly units on F10 map as you are able to communicate with friendly forces
and know where they are. Enemy units are hidden from the F10 map and you need to scan the target area to locate enemy forces.

- JTAC Primary Frequency: 141.0 (OLIVE 3) - (Range 15 secondary frequency) 
- JTAC Secondary frequency:  240.0 VIOLET 1) - (Range 15 primary frequency)

### ADMIN
- Basic CAS Scenario  need to be activated via F10 menu (units will then in place in accordance with scenario above), use F10 menu: "Activate Basic CAS scenario"
- Mortar team will send message before they start firing. Pay attention to messages ingame. (Will provide maxord, GTL, TOF,and duration)
- Range 15 is on the border to Bodø CTR. JTAC and/or flight need to ensure good deconfliction with Bodø ATC prior and during execution.
- Flight are to maintain comms with Bodø ATC on Bodø Approach freq during all operations on range 15 (unless otherwise directed by Bodø ATC)

# Tactical Close Air Support (CAS) scenario-2

### GENERAL BACKGROUND:
1)	The mission takes place within insurgents-held territory.<br />
2)	Insurgents have set up a command post in building in the village<br />
3)	A friendly SOF team is set to enter the CP, grab high value intelligence items and egress.<br />

### INTELLIGENCE:
4)	Insurgents have based a garrison force in the village and surrounding villages based on pickup trucks armed with heavy machineguns and stolen military equipment based on Eastern-bloc equipment.<br />
5)	A roadblock defends the village access road South of the village, approx. 2km away.<br />
6)	Enemy is known to possess SHORAD air-defenses in the sector. Such ADS are likely to be present IVO the village.<br />
7)	Arial photo of the village and the CP location:<br />
 <img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d5d12f7-d9a8-430e-b24f-ad71c6740546" />
 
### GFC MISSION
1)	Conduct the approach to the CP in one of two ways (Based on the desired CAS training topics) :<br />
  a.	Option 1: A SOF team will advance into the village on foot from the WEST. <br />
Or:
  b.	Option 2: A SOF team will use a pair of STRYKER IFVs placed on a road a few km to the SOUTHWEST, and advance into the village.<br />
2)	Whichever SOF being used, will need to be brought close to the CP building at N67 26.060 / E014 46.400 / Elev.126ft .<br />

### GFC INTENT FOR CAS
1)	Shape conditions for a safe approach and egress by the SOF team by eliminating enemy combatants in the area.<br />
2)	Targets and priorities:<br />
   a.	100% of MBTs, IFVs and APCs in the AO.<br />
   b.	75% of armed pickup trucks in the AO.<br />
   c.	75% of dismounted infantry in the AO.<br />
3)	Provide close support to the SOF throughout the operation by isolating the AO from adjacent enemy forces.<br />

### FRIENDLY DEPLOYMENT
1)	JTAC position: N67 26.050 / E014 14.430 / 87ft / About 1000m West of the village.<br />
2)	SOF team starting position (Infantry): Collocated the JTAC position.<br />
3)	SOF team starting position (APCs): N67 24 .420 / E014 41.520 / 105ft / On the access road to the village, about 2.5km to the SW.<br />

### RESTRICTIONS
1)	Minimize collateral damage. Noncombatants are still present in the village.<br />
2)	Within 100m from the village perimeter, only the following ordnance types are approved:<br />
   a.	Forward-firing, AP warheads. <br />
   b.	50cal rounds or smaller. <br />
3)	Further out, the use of warheads up to 500lb HE is approved.<br />
4)	Cluster munitions are prohibited.<br />
 


### ADMIN
1)	All enemy units are set to engage only ground units. Training air-assets will not be targeted (To facilitate safety of training environment). However low-level flying assets could potentially face a small risk of damage due to ricochets from ground fires. <br />
2)	All control of the SOF teams is by the JTAC / GFC. <br />
3)	For simplicity, SOF arrival close to the objective CP counts as a successful ingress. SOF withdrawal back to its starting point counts as a successful EXFIL. <br />
4)	As soon as ANY of the two SOF choices starts moving towards the village, the OTHER SOF will shortly thereafter deactivate and disappear to prevent confusion. <br />
5)	Communications: based on Range-15 frequencies. <br />
6)	Range-15 is near the TMA, ensure air assets are deconflicted: either within R15 airspace or above FL195 if extending to the SOUTH towards BODO. <br />
