## Air to Air trainer
The Air to Air training system provides both BFM and BVR training drones. The drones are deployed as CAP flights orginating in one of three patrol zones. The North, Centre, South patrol zones for Range 33 are roughly 70nm from the eastern edge.  
4 configurable groups make presetting your requirement easy. There is no limit to the number of spawnable group yet.  

## Drone units
The system currently includes: 
- **MIG23MLD** (*APU602M*, R24R)
- **MIG29A** (*R60M*, R73, R27R)
- **SU30** (*R73*, R77, R27ER)

## Control
Select mode **BVR** or BFM  
This defines the load and max detection range of the drone groups.  
BVR max detection range ~120nm.  
BFM max detection range ~30nm. 

Groups 1-4 allow the configuration of your required engagement airframes that can be configured through the Group Config Menu even before you leave the ground. 

## Enemy ROE
- When spawned drones execute a CAP mission in the vacinity of their spawn zone. 
- Drones will only engage targets inside the range.  
- If the drones leave the range, they will return to their initial mission.
