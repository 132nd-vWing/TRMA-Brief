# Range 33

## Air to Air trainer
The Air to Air training system provides both BFM and BVR training drones. The drones are deployed as CAP Flights roginiating in one of three patrol zones. The patrol zones for Range 33 are roughly 70nm from the eastern edge. 

## Drone units
The system currently includes: 
- **MIG23MLD** (*APU602M*\*, R24R)
- MIG25PD (*R40TD*, R40RD)
- **MIG29A** (*R60M*, R73, R27R)
- MIG31 (*R73*, R77, R29ER)
- SU27 (*R73*, R27ET, R27ER)
- **SU30** (*R73*, R77, R27ER)
- J11A (*R73*, R27ER, R77)
- **JF17** (*PL-5EII*, SD10-A)

\* BFM loadouts are simply IR forward shown in italics.
\*\* Default Groups are in bold face.

## Control
Use the range 33 drone system as follows: 

Select mode - BVR/BFM
This determines the spawned groups load and max detection range. BVR max detection range ~120nm. BFM max detection range ~30nm. Load outs for BFM are predominantly IR equipped. 

Preset Spawns are commonly used enemy flights.
Custom Spawn can be edited with the config menu. 
Random Group will spawn a randomised group, size, airframe and zone. 

Drones will only engage targets inside the range. 
Drones will return to their patrol if they attempt to leave the range.
