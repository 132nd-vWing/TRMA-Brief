# Range 33

## Air to Air trainer
The Air to Air training system provides both BFM and BVR training drones. The drones are deployed as CAP Flights orginating in one of three patrol zones. The patrol zones for Range 33 are roughly 70nm from the eastern edge distributed from SW to NE. The menu currently offers three preset groups and one customisable group defaulted to the JF17.  

## Drone units
The system currently includes: 
- **MIG23MLD** (*APU602M*, R24R)
- **MIG29A** (*R60M*, R73, R27R)
- **SU30** (*R73*, R77, R27ER)
- JF17 (*PL-5EII*, SD10-A)
- MIG25PD (*R40TD*, R40RD)
- MIG31 (*R73*, R77, R29ER)
- SU27 (*R73*, R27ET, R27ER)
- J11A (*R73*, R27ER, R77)

## Control
Select mode **BVR** or BFM  
This defines the load and max detection range of the drone groups.  
BVR max detection range ~120nm.  
BFM max detection range ~30nm. 

Preset Spawns are commonly used enemy flights. If you would like these altered please raise with the IPs.  
The custom group can be altered as required.  
Spawn Random Group will spawn a randomised group, size, airframe and zone. 

Drones will only engage targets inside the range.  
If the drones leave the range, they will return to their origin zone and cap.  
The group names are randomised, that means there is no limit to the number of groups that can be active. Be mindful of this, as excessive spawning.
