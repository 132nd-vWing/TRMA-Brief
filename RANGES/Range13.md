## RANGE-13 CAS SCENARIO #1

### GENERAL BACKGROUND:
A critical MSR is running East-West via a T-junction about 8km South of MISVAER. Enemy has been using this MSR to move reinforcements and supplies around the area.

### GFC MISSION
Advance SOUTH from the LD and seize the T-junction area by positioning units from BLUE task force as follows:
•	A mechanized platoon at OBJECTIVE ALPHA, deployed to attack enemy forces arriving from the SOUTH-WEST.
•	A mechanized platoon at OBJECTIVE BRAVO, deployed to attack enemy forces arriving from the SOUTH-EAST
The above end-state is aimed at denying the enemy of moving combat units and supplies EAST and WEST in the area.

### INTELLIGENCE
1)	Enemy force is estimated at 1x mechanized company + 1x armored platoon. Supporting assets are short-range air defenses, artillery and RECON.
2)	Enemy QRF (Quick Reaction Force) is presumed to be on alert in the region to reinforce local defenses as needed. QRF composition is estimated as an additional mech/armored company.
3)	Enemy has established a defensive line about 5km south of MISVAER blocking our advance to the SOUTH.

### FRIENDLY DEPLOYMENT
•	JTAC position N67 04.82 / E015 00.44 / 830ft (Several MANPAD units)
•	Taskforce line of departure (LD): N67 05.290 E014 58.920. A pair of STRYKERs are in a defensive position with the rest of the TF standing by on the road slightly North of them.
•	TF composition:
o	2x pairs of HMMWV vehicles for RECON
o	3x mechanized platoons, each consisting of (2x) STRYKER ICVs and (1x) ATGM STRYKER
•	Artillery position (3x mortars) at N67 06.3 / E015 00.1 (North of the TF)

### ADMIN
1)	All enemy units are set to engage only ground units. Training air-assets will not be targeted (To facilitate safety of training environment). However low-level flying assets could potentially face a small risk of damage due to ricochets from ground fires.
2)	JTAC options: The JTAC training may be done via one of several positions / perspectives:
  a.	OP with several MANPADs in overwatch at N67 04.82 / E015 00.44 / 830ft
  b.	Two pairs of scout HMMWVs parked alongside the TF and may be driven to any desired location and be used for observation / controlling

3)	BLUE task force groups are moved manually (By the JTAC or a GFC).
4)	BLUE units are set to HOLD FIRE (May be changed in-game as needed)
