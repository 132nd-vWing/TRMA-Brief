- Continue attack along two axis (toward ROGNAN and MOLDJORD
- Air defenses south of attacking forces to protect own high value targets
- Low use of artillery due to ammunition shortages

Enemy Most Dangerous Course of Action (COA):
- Converge on one AXIS toward ROGNAN and attack at full strengt toward ROGNAN and continue toward FAUSKE

## Range-14. CAS Scenario-1

### GENERAL BACKGROUND:
1)	Enemy insurgents have been using the town of ROGNAN as a resupply hub for their forces further South.<br />
2)	ROGNAN is under enemy control with friendly side to the WEST, FLOT is along the ridgeline WEST of the valley.<br />
3)	Friendly RECON has been on station in a house in ROGNAN to monitor enemy movements and communications.<br />
4)	A few hours ago, the enemy activity in and around ROGNAN increased with SIGINT indicating that the enemy is alerted to the presence of a recon team in the town.<br />
5)	RECON team is at risk of being overrun and its EXFIL routes are shut off.<br />

### GFC MISSION
1)	GFC will command a friendly taskforce into the town to secure and extract the RECON.

### INTELLIGENCE
1)	The enemy has blocked all routes out of the town with static roadblocks and anti-vehicle ATGM teams. Mobile patrols are active in and around the town.<br />
2)	Enemy strength IVO ROGNAN is estimated at 1+ company of IFVs, APCs, technical and short-range air defenses.<br />
3)	Additional enemy reinforcements are expected to arrive from the SOUTH in the coming hours. These reinforcements may include armored elements as well.

### FRIENDLY DEPLOYMENT
1)	JTAC position: N67 04.870 / E015 20.300 / 830ft. <br />
2)	RECON TEAM: N67 05.100 / E015 22.600 / 18ft /Simulated by a few MANPADs and a HMMWV near a house). <br />
3)	Taskforce consisting of western-type MBTs, IFVs line of departure (LD): N67 03.000 / E015 17.400 / 840ft. <br />

### ADMIN
1)	All enemy units are set to engage only ground units. Training air-assets will not be targeted (To facilitate safety of training environment). However low-level flying assets could potentially face a small risk of damage due to ricochets from ground fires.
   
2)	JTAC options: The JTAC training may be done via one of several positions / perspectives: <br />
a.	OP with several MANPADs in overwatch at N67 04.870 / E015 20.300 / 830ft. <br />
b.	A pair of scout HMMWVs parked alongside the TF and may be driven to any desired location and be used for observation / controlling. <br />
c.	MANPADs and HMMWV in the RECON hiding position.<br />

4)	Taskforce may be deployed in several ways depending on JTAC / GFC discretion and desired complexity of the training scenario: <br />
   
a.	NONE AT ALL – Use only air power to clear the way for the RECON team to EXFIL based on their HMMWV. <br />
b.	MANUALLY – The JTAC / JTAC and GFC would coordinate and employ the taskforce groups at their discretion. <br />
c.	 AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENT – "At the flip of the switch" the taskforce would deploy to assume positions to cover the entry/exit routes, clearing the JTAC to focus on CAS missions. To use this, drive the M113 named " R14_CAS1-BLUE-SWITCH-TRIGGER" and place it closer to the bunker on the road just East of it. This function would deploy the TF as follows:<br />
i.	1xMBT + 1xIFV to take a defensive position on the South side of the town covering to the South. <br />
ii.	2x IFVs taking positions in the Center of the town covering to the North-East. <br />
iii.	2x IFVs advancing to the RECON position and assuming a defensive position there.<br />
